Second version of small youtube app clone built with react. 
First one was with @mui/material styling, this one I did the CSS myself. 


User can search for a movie. List of 5 videos is returned from the youtube api. First video can be played, user can click another video from the list on the right to be played. App is responsive, video list goes below the main video when screen is smaller. 


npm i
npm start
